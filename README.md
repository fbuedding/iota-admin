# IoTA-Admin
The Fiware IoT-Agent Admin will be a service to manage IoT-Agents.

As it's right now, the iot-agent-sdk is in a usable, stable and released state.

## Why is the release version so high?
I made a mistake and released a v1.4.x which lead to go thinking an old version is the latest version.
Now it is v1.7.0 because I made some changes to the iot-agent-sdk.

## What's inside?
The project for now is a monorepo. Thus containing iot-agent-sdk, server code, web-templates, static html and other assets.
This may change in future.

## Features that are usable
